##Notes
**This plugin is in BETA. I do not recommend you install on a production server. It has been done so before without issue, though.**

Q: Why would I use this plugin over third party software?
A: A medium-sized community needed a store to sell products and I didn't like the idea of using third party software as they are usually too big, slow and difficult to customise. Instead I wrote my own software in the form of a plugin, so forum admins can customise it like any other plugin. That's why you would use this plugin.

The biggest benefit, the reason why I encourage you to use third party software until this plugin is ready, to third party software is it's secure and has been **confirmed** secure. Although I trust my code, I don't trust people to spend a lot of their real money in this.

The thing is this store is more of a middle man than an all-in-one-replace-PayPal solution. It's designed to simply list products for sale, organise orders and then deliver your users to a PayPal page where they give you the money. The money is then in your account and that's all that matters. My plugin just lets you easily handle products and orders.

Have fun with it!
